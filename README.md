# Hello world!
This is my "Portfolio Project", I want to make a 2Dshooter game which can be played from 2 Players.
Things that I want to add:
 - 2 maps (players can chose on which map they want to play before starting the game)
 - Player health and ammo bar
 - Score board
 - Bbjects (boxes) on both sides of the field, where the players can hide from the bullets
 - Sound when shooting
 - Hitboxes (body - 50hp, head - 100hp)
